# TikTok Clone Project

This project is a clone of the popular TikTok app. It consists of two main components: a client-side web application (`tiktok-client`) and a server-side API (`tiktok-server`).

The main goal of the project is to learn and practice Web Development skills that require knowledge of different technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJs, NodeJs, MongoDB, etc.

This project is STILL in development and more features will be implemented in the future, as well as error fixing and performance improvement.

## Viewing Recommendations

- **Screen Size:** 13-inch display or larger
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 pixels or higher

## What is there in Tiktok-clone?

There are currently a few things you can do on this web application project:

1. Sign up, and log in with your account.
2. Reset your password with a reset token sent through email (currently NOT available since I'm using Mailtrap.io instead of a paid service for email sending).
3. Watch a list of random videos or of the users you are following.
4. Like a video.
5. Comment on a video.
6. Save a video to your favorite list.
7. Follow a user.
8. Upload a video and select a frame of it as cover (thumbnail).
9. Change the app language.
10. Toggle between dark mode and light mode.

## Soon to be implemented

1. Responsive layout.
2. Notification.
3. Messaging.
4. Video's view count tracking.
5. Login with Facebook, Google, etc with Firebase authentication.
6. Users' stories.
7. Server-side media optimization.
8. Content based on geopositioning.
9. ... and many more.

## Technologies used

- React.js for the client-side application
- Node.js and Express.js for the server-side API
- MongoDB for database storage
- Firebase Storage for media storage
- Netlify for client deployment
- Render for server deployment

## Client deployment

The client-side web app (`tiktok-client`) is deployed on Netlify. You can access the deployed website at https://klong-tiktok-clone.netlify.app.

## Server deployment

The server-side API (`tiktok-server`) is deployed on Render.com. You can access the deployed API at https://tiktok-server-cr45.onrender.com. <br/>
It might take a minute for the server to start up on your first access.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KhanhLong611/tiktok-clone.git
